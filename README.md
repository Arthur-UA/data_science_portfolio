## Projects
- ### Machine learning
  - [Delivery Duration Prediction](https://github.com/ArturUA/data_science_portfolio/tree/main/DeliveryDurationPrediction): Tuned machine learning algorithm that predicts delivery duration from the Door Dash delivery company to the customer in seconds by some particular set of features. The dataset used in project is a public data posted by Door Dash company on the Strata Scratch website.
  - [Verification of ensemble models](https://github.com/ArturUA/data_science_portfolio/tree/main/EnsembleModelsVerification): This project was created to understand the differences between all available types of ensemble models, to check out their ROC AUC score and build confusion matrices. The dataset used in this project is public data that can be accessed via the [link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/713/auction+verification).
- ### Deep learning
  - [CNN for motorcycles classifier](https://github.com/ArturUA/data_science_portfolio/tree/main/MotorcyclesClassifier): Convolutional neural network for predicting the class of motorcycle by image. Models were trained to predict three classes of motorcycles (sporbikes, city bikes and toutist bikes). The dataset consists of pictures of different classes of motorcycles collected from various search engines. The demo is available by the [link](https://huggingface.co/spaces/fr3man/motorcycle_classifier).
- ### Data Analysis and visualization
  - [Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Spotify songs dataset.](https://github.com/ArturUA/data_science_portfolio/tree/main/SpotifySongsEDA): The purpose of this task is to give an overview on the open Spotify Songs dataset from Kaggle. To check what factors are more important in defining whether the song is going to be popular.
